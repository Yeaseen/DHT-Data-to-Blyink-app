What we are doing here!!!! 


First we have a DHT22 sensor(Temperature and Humidity). It sense and make a gives an digital output voltage over the time. That voltage was taken by NodeMCU Lilon V3. 

Then we convert that to analogue value using DHT libraries and showing it to serial monitor in Arduino IDE. 

Then we make a connection to Blynk app's project via authentication annd nodes wifi modules help. 


Send the data(temperature and humidity) to blynk's over virtual pin. It will be shown in the app screen.
